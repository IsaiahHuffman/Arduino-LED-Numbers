# Arduino-LED-Numbers
Simple design using LEDs that displays numbers 0-9 on an Ardunio Uno using two breadboards.

Designed using the generic "scoreboard" number layout, where any number can be represented using at most seven bars. In this instance, each "bar" is two red LEDs that share the same current.

Here is a video of it running. Due to compression and that two of my resistors are stronger than the rest, the video makes the numbers a little blurry. I apologize.
