# Arduino-LED-Numbers
Simple design using LEDs that displays numbers 0-9 on an Ardunio Uno using two breadboards.

Designed using the generic "scoreboard" number layout, where any number can be represented using at most seven bars. In this instance, each "bar" is two red LEDs that share the same current.
